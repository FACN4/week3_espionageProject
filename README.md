### User journey

The user wants to know about the different FAC campuses, their github commit statistics and information about the locations. The target users are snooping FAC members.

### Project file/coding structure

  One key difficult of this project was structuring the capture of data. In order to keep control of this we used constructor functions to create uniform data types which were used to pass around data in the system.

  The repository directory structure was chosen to separate the many javascript files from the others. Splitting javascript functions into this many files was beneficial as it enabled us to clearly understand the flow of data and responsibilities of each file.
